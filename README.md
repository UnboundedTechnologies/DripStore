# UNBOUNDED TECHNOLOGIES' DRIP STORE

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/stripe](http://localhost:3000/api/stripe). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/stripe.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

This is what I used for this project:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
- [Sanity Documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs) - to understand core concepts, and explore a variety of resources to help you get the most from Sanity.
- [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs) - to integrate Stripe. Payments. Build a web or mobile integration to accept payments online or in person.
